# RL demo codes (PyTorch)

One year ago, there used to be an older RL demo code repo implemented with TensorFlow which I am not that familiar with. So, I just deleted that repo and try to open a new one, and that is this repo!

I have already done my undergraduate final project with simple Meta RL (MAML / GrBAL). So, it may be true that I have learnt **a little** knowledge about RL which should be adequate for opening this repo.

It is time for me to learn RL again to gain a more solid theoretical fundation for more projects when pursuing a PhD in future 5 years **or more**.
